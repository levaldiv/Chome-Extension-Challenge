# Chrome-Youtube Extension Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Chrome-Youtube Extension Challenge! I was tasked to create a Chrome extenstion that bookmarks the timestamps on YouTube. This was definitely another challeging YET exciting build as it was created with JavaScript and the new iteration of the web extensions platform, called Manifest V3.

## Core Features

- Created with JavaScript and the new iteration of the web extensions platform, called Manifest V3
- Icon that shows up on the YouTube video player that will allow you to bookmark a particular timestamp
- Uses Chrome's local storage to store the saved bookmarks
- Worked with a Content Script to manipulate the DOM
- Created a basic UI for the extension
- Utilized service workers as background scripts
